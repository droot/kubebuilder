Because the structure of the Schema and Endpoints are predictable\nand structured, most Kubernetes tools work with any Kubernetes API even if they\nare not part of the core (e.g. extensions through CRDs).\nWhat is a Declarative API\nA declarative API expresses a fixed state that the cluster must continually\nwork towards.  Declarative APIs define the what, but not the how.\nExample: $ replicas 3\nAn imperative API expresses an operation that may change state, but does not\ndefine an absolute state that must be maintained.  Imperative APIs express the\nhow, but not what.  Example: $ add-pods 2.\nIn the declarative case, if a replica is lost the cluster has a clear directive\nto create another one, whereas in the latter case this is not necessarily true.\nDeclarative API usage example by invoking apply.\n# object.yaml contains an object declaration\n$ kubectl apply -f object.yaml\n\n\n\nDeclarative HowConstraints on the how may be defined within declarative APIs, such as performing a rolling update\nversus deleting and recreating all Pods immediately.\n\nResource Schema\nGroup, Version, Kind\nEvery Kubernetes resource has a Group, Version and Kind that uniquely identifies it.\n\nThe resource Kind is the name of the API - such as Deployment or Service.\nThe resource Version defines the stability of the API and backward compatibility guarantees -\nsuch as v1beta1 or v1.\nThe resource Group is similar to package in a language.  It disambiguates different APIs\nthat may happen to have identically named Kinds.  Groups often contain a domain name, such as k8s.io.\n\nDeployment yaml config Group Version Kind\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\n\n\n\nVersionsResources with different Versions but the same Group and Kind differ in the following ways:\n\nUnspecified fields may have different defaults\nThe same logical fields may have different names or representations\n\nHowever resources with different versions frequently share the same features and controller.\nAlpha APIs may break backwards compatibility by changing field names, defaults or behavior.  They\nalso may not be supported in the future.\nBeta APIs maintain backwards compatibility on field names, defaults and behavior.  They may be\nmissing features required for GA.  However once the API goes GA, the features should be available\nin the Beta version.\nGA APIs have been available and running in production for sufficient time to have developed\na stable set of field names and defaults, as well as a complete feature set.\n\nSpec, Status, Metadata\nMost Kubernetes Resource Schemas contain 3 components: Spec, Status and Metadata\nSpec: the Resource Spec defines the desired state of the cluster as specified by the user.\nStatus: the Resource Status publishes the state of the cluster as observed by the controller.\nMetadata: the Resource Metadata contains information common to most resources about the object\nincluding as the object name, annotations, labels and more.\nNote: this config has been abbreviated for the purposes of display\nDeployment yaml config with Spec Status and Metadata\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  template:\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - image: nginx\n        name: nginx\nstatus:\n  replicas: 1\n  unavailableReplicas: 1\n  updatedReplicas: 1\n\n\n\nSpec vs StatusThe resource Status should not contain the source of truth for any information, and should be\npossible for Controllers to recreate by looking at the cluster state.  Other values assigned by\nControllers, such as the Service spec.clusterIp, should be set on the Spec not the Status.\n\nResource Endpoints\nKubernetes Resources have well defined endpoints as described below.\nCreate, Update, Patch, Delete\nThe create, update, patch and delete endpoints may be used to modify objects.  The update endpoint\nreplaces the object with what is provided, whereas the patch endpoint selectively updates\nfields.\nGet, List, Watch\nThe get, list and watch endpoints may be used to get a specific resource by name, list all\nresources matching a labels, or continually watch for updates.\nDeployment Endpoints under /apis/apps/v1\nname: \"deployments\"\nkind: \"Deployment\"\nverbs:\n- \"create\"\n- \"delete\"\n- \"deletecollection\"\n- \"get\"\n- \"list\"\n- \"patch\"\n- \"update\"\n- \"watch\"\n\n\n\nAPI versionsWhen reading objects, the same objects should be returned regardless of which version of the API endpoint is\nread from (though the structure may differ between versions).\nWhen writing objects, the default values applied to fields may change between API versions, but\nthe written object should be visible when read from any version.\n\nWarning on UpdatesThe update API should only be used to read-then-write an object, and never used to\nupdate an object directly from declarative config.  This is because the object state\nmay be partially managed by Controllers running in the cluster and this state would\nbe lost when the update replaces the current object with the declarative config.\nIllustrative example: updating a Service from declarative config rather than a read-then-write\nwould clear the Service spec.clusterIp field set by the controller.\n\nWatch TimeoutsIf used directly, a watch API call will timeout and need to be re-established.  The kubebuilder\nlibraries hide the details behind watches from users and automatically re-establish connections.\n\nSubresources\nWhile most operations can be represented declaratively, some may not, such as\nlogs, attach or exec.  These operations may be implemented as subresources.\nSubresources are functions attached to resources, but that have their\nown Schema and Endpoints.  By having different resources each implement\nthe same subresource API, resources can implemented shared interfaces.\nFor example Deployment, ReplicaSet and StatefulSet each implement the\nscale subresource API, making it easy to build tools which scale any of them\nas well as scale any other resources that implement the scale subresource.\nDeployment Scale Subresource Endpoints under /apis/apps/v1\nname: \"deployments/scale\"\ngroup: \"autoscaling\"\nversion: \"v1\"\nkind: \"Scale\"\nverbs:\n- \"get\"\n- \"patch\"\n- \"update\"\n\n\n\nLabels, Selectors and Annotations\nLabels in ObjectMeta data are key-value pairs that may be queried to find matching objects.\nLabels are used to connect objects together in a Kubernetes cluster.  For instance\nServices use labels to determine which Pods to direct traffic to, and Deployments use labels\n(along with OwnersReferences) to identify Pods they created.\nAnnotations allow arbitrary data to be written to resources that may not fit within the\nSchema of the resource, but may be needed by end users or tools.\nExtending Built In TypesAnnotations may be used to define new extension fields on resources without modifying the\nSchema of the object.  This allows users to define their own private schema extensions for\nexisting core Kubernetes resources.\n\nNamespaces\nWhile most resources are Namespaced, that is the objects are scoped to a Namespace, some resources\nare non-namespaces and scoped to the cluster.  Examples of non-namespaced resources include\nNodes, Namespaces and ClusterRole.\n"},"basics/simple_resource.html":{"url":"basics/simple_resource.html","title":"Resource Example","keywords":"","body":"Resource Example\nThis chapter walks through the definition of a new Resource call ContainerSet.

Unlike Controllers in the ModelViewController\npattern, Kubernetes Controllers are run asynchronously after the Resources (Models) have\nbeen written to storage.  This model is highly flexible and allows new Controllers to be\nadded for Models through extension instead of modification.\nA Kubernetes Controller is a routine running in a Kubernetes cluster that watches for create /\nupdate / delete events on Resources, and triggers a Reconcile function in response.  Reconcile\nis a function that may be called at any time with the Namespace and Name of an object (Resource\ninstance), and it will make the cluster state match the state declared in the object Spec.\nUpon completion, Reconcile updates the object Status the new actual state.\nIt is common for Controllers to watch for changes to the Resource type that they Reconcile\nand Resource types of objects they create.  e.g. a ReplicaSet Controller watches for\nchanges to ReplicaSets and Pods.  The Controller will trigger a Reconcile for a ReplicaSet\nin response to either an event for that ReplicaSet or in response to an event for a\nPod created by that ReplicaSet.\nIn some cases Reconcile may only update the Status without updating any cluster state.  \nIllustrative example:\n\nA ReplicaSet object is created with 10 replicas specified in the Spec\nReplicaSetController Reconcile reads the Spec and lists the Pods owned by the ReplicaSet\nNo Pods are found, ReplicaSetController creates 10 Pods and updates the Status with 0/10 Pods running\nReplicaSetController Reconcile is triggered as the Pods start running, and updates Status in the\nReplicaSet object.\n\nKubernetes APIs and Controllers have level based implementations to facilitate self-\nhealing and periodic reconciliation.  This means no state is provided to the Reconcile\nwhen it is called.\nWhat is a Level Based API\nThe term level-based comes from interrupts hardware, where interrupts may be either level-based or edge-based.\nKubernetes defines a level-based API as implemented by reading the observed (actual) state of the system,\ncomparing it to what is declared in the object Spec, and making changes to the system state so\nit matches the state of the Spec at the time Reconcile is called.\nThis has a number of notable properties:\n\nReconcile skips intermediate or obsolete values declared in the Spec and\nworks directly toward the current Spec.\nReconcile may batch multiple events together before processing them instead\nof handling each individually\n\nConsider the following examples of level based API implementations.\nExample 1: Batching Events\nA user creates a ReplicaSet with 1000 replicas.  The ReplicaSet creates 1000 Pods and maintains a\nStatus field with the number of healthy Pods.  In a level based system, the Controller batches\nthe Pod updates together (the Reconcile only gets the ReplicaSet Namespace and Name) before triggering\nthe Reconcile.  In an edge based system, the Controller responds to each individual Pod event, potentially\nperforming 1000 sequential updates to the Status instead of 1.\nExample 2: Skipping Obsolete States\nA user creates a rollout for a Deployment containing a new container image.  Shortly after\nstarting the rollout, the user realizes the containers are crash looping because they need\nto increase memory thresholds when running the new image.\nThe user updates the Deployment with the new memory limit to start a new rollout.  In a\nlevel based system, the Controller will immediately stop rolling out the old values and start\nthe rollout for the new values.  In an edge based system the Controller may complete the first\nrollout before starting the next.\nWatching Events\nThe Controller Reconcile is triggered both by cluster events.\nWatching Resources\nControllers must watch for events for the Resource they Reconcile.  The ReplicaSetController\nwatches for changes to ReplicaSets and triggers a Reconcile in response.\nReplicaSet Creation\nThe following diagram shows a creation event triggering a reconcile.\nCreated with Raphaël 2.1.4APIAPIReplicaSetControllerReplicaSetControllerUser creates ReplicaSetReplicaSet Create EventReconcile ReplicaSet\nWatching Created Resources\nControllers should watch for events on the Resources they create.  The ReplicaSetController watches\nfor Pod events.  If a Pod is deleted, the ReplicaSetController will see the Pod event and\nReconcile the ReplicaSet that created the Pod so it can create a new one.\nReplicaSet Creation And Self-Healing\nThe following diagram shows a series of events after creating a new ReplicaSet and then a Pod getting deleted.\nCreated with Raphaël 2.1.4APIAPIReplicaSetControllerReplicaSetControllerUser creates ReplicaSetReplicaSet Create EventReconcile ReplicaSetRead ReplicaSetList PodsCreate Pod 1Create Pod 2Create Pod 3Update ReplicaSet StatusPods started on NodesPod 1 Running EventPod 2 Running EventPod 3 Running EventReconcile ReplicaSetRead ReplicaSetList PodsUpdate ReplicaSet StatusUser deletes Pod 1Pod 1 Deleted EventReconcile ReplicaSetRead ReplicaSetList PodsCreate Pod 4Update ReplicaSet Status\nWatching Related Resource Events\nControllers may watch for events on Resources that are related, but they did not create.  The\nDaemonSetController watches for changes to Nodes.  If a new Node is created, the Controller\nwill create a new Pod scheduled on that Node.  In this case, all DaemonSet objects are reconciled\neach time a Node is created.\nCreate Objects During Reconciliation\nMany Controllers create new Kubernetes objects as part of a reconcile.  These objects\nare owned by the object responsible for their creation.\nThis relationship is recorded both in an OwnersReference in the ObjectMeta of the created\nobjects and through labels (on the created object) + selectors (on the created object).\nThe labels + selectors allow the creating controller to find all of the objects it has created,\nby listing them using their label.  The OwnersReference maps the created object to its\nowner when there is an event for the created object.\nWriting Status Back to Objects\nControllers are run asynchronously, meaning that the user operation will return a success to\nthe user before the Controller is run.  If there are issues when the Controller is run,\nsuch as the container image being invalid, the user will not be notified.\nInstead the Controller must write back the Status of the object at each Reconcile and\nusers must check the object Status.\nStatusThe controller will keep Status up-to-date both in response to user initiated events, but also\nin response to non-user initiated events, such as Node failures.\n\nWalkthrough: a Deployment Rollout across Deployments, ReplicaSets, Pods\nFollowing is a walkthrough of a Deployment Rolling update.\nKubectl commands\nUsing kubectl, it is possible to call the same watch API used by controllers to trigger\nreconciles.  The following example watches Deployments, ReplicaSets and Pods; creates a Deployment;\nand updates the Deployment with a new container image (triggering a rolling update).\n# watch deployments in terminal 1\nkubectl get -w deployments\n\n# watch replicasets in terminal 2\nkubectl get -w replicasets\n\n# watch pods in terminal 3\nkubectl get -w pods \n\n# create deployment\nkubectl run nginx --image nginx:1.12 --replicas 3\n\n# rollout new image\nkubectl set image deployments nginx *=nginx:1.13\n\nFlow Diagram\nCreated with Raphaël 2.1.4APIAPIDeploymentControllerDeploymentControllerReplicaSetControllerReplicaSetControllerSchedulerSchedulerNode (Kubelet)Node (Kubelet)User creates DeploymentDeployment Create EventReconcile DeploymentCreate ReplicaSetReplicaSet Create EventReconcile ReplicaSetCreate PodsPod Create EventsReconcile PodsSchedule Pods To NodesPod Update EventsReconcile PodsStart ContainerUpdate Pod StatusPod Update EventsReconcile ReplicaSetUpdate ReplicaSet StatusPod Update EventsReplicaSet Update EventsReconcile DeploymentUpdate Deployment Status\nControllers vs Operators\nControllers that implement an API for a specific application, such as Etcd, Spark or Cassandra are\noften referred to as Operators.\n"},"basics/simple_controller.html":{"url":"basics/simple_controller.html","title":"Controller Example","keywords":"","body":"Controller Example\nThis chapter walks through a simple Controller implementation.\nThis example is for the Controller for the ContainerSet API shown in the Resource Example.\nIt uses the controller-runtime libraries\nto implement the Controller and Manager.\nUnlike the Hello World example, here we use the underlying Controller libraries directly instead\nof the higher-level application pattern libraries.

The Source provides events\nfor some type, and the EventHandler responds to events by enqueuing reconcile.Requests for objects.\nWatch optionally takes a list of Predicates that may be used to filter events.\nSources\n\nTo watch for create / update / delete events for an object use a source.KindSource e.g.\nsource.KindSource{Type: &v1.Pod}\n\nHandlers\n\nTo enqueue a Reconcile for the object in the event use a handler.EnqueueRequestForObject\nTo enqueue a Reconcile for the owner object that created the object in the event use a handler.EnqueueRequestForOwner\nwith the type of the owner e.g. &handler.EnqueueRequestForOwner{OwnerType: &appsv1.Deployment{}, IsController: true}\nTo enqueue Reconcile requests for an arbitrary collection of objects in response to the event, use a\nhandler.EnqueueRequestsFromMapFunc.\n\nExample:\n\nCreate a new ContainerSetController struct that will.\nInvoke Reconcile with the Name and Namespace of a ContainerSet for ContainerSet create / update / delete events\nInvoke Reconcile with the Name and Namespace of a ContainerSet for Deployment create / update / delete events\n\n\n\nReference\n\nSee the controller libraries godocs for reference\ndocumentation on the controller libraries.\nSee the controller code generation tags\ngodocs for reference documentation on controller annotations.\n\ntype ContainerSetController struct {\n  client.Client\n  scheme *runtime.Scheme\n}\n\nfunc Add(mgr manager.Manager) error (\n  // Create a new Controller\n  c, err := controller.New(\"containerset-controller\", mgr,\n    controller.Options{Reconciler: &ContainerSetController{\n      Client: mgr.GetClient(),\n      scheme: mgr.GetScheme(),\n  }})\n  if err != nil {\n    return err\n  }\n\n  // Watch for changes to ContainerSet\n  err = c.Watch(\n    &source.Kind{Type:&workloadsv1beta1.ContainerSet{}},\n      &handler.EnqueueRequestForObject{})\n  if err != nil {\n    return err\n  }\n\n    // Watch for changes to Deployments created by a ContainerSet and trigger a Reconcile for the owner\n  err = c.Watch(\n    &source.Kind{Type: &appsv1.Deployment{}},\n      &handler.EnqueueRequestForOwner{\n        IsController: true,\n        OwnerType:    &workloadsv1beta1.ContainerSet{},\n      })\n  if err != nil {\n    return err\n  }\n\n  return nil\n}\n\n\n\nAdding Annotations For Watches And CRUD OperationsIt is important// +kubebuilder:rbac annotations when adding Watches or CRUD operations\nso that when the Controller is deployed it will have the correct permissions.\nmake must be run anytime annotations are changed to regenerated code and configs.\n\nImplementing Controller Reconcile\nLevel vs EdgeThe Reconcile function does not differentiate between create, update or deletion events.\nInstead it simply reads the state of the cluster at the time it is called.\n\nReconcile uses a client.Client to read and write objects.  The Client is able to\nread or write any type of runtime.Object (e.g. Kubernetes object), so users don't need\nto generate separate clients for each collection of APIs.\nThe business logic of the Controller is implemented in the Reconcile function.  This function takes the Namespace\n and Name of a ContainerSet, allowing multiple Events to be batched together into a single Reconcile call.\nThe function shown here creates or updates a Deployment using the replicas and image specified in\nContainerSet.Spec.  Note that it sets an OwnerReference for the Deployment to enable garbage collection\non the Deployment once the ContainerSet is deleted.\n\nRead the ContainerSet using the NamespacedName\nIf there is an error or it has been deleted, return\nCreate the new desired DeploymentSpec from the ContainerSetSpec\nRead the Deployment and compare the Deployment.Spec to the ContainerSet.Spec\nIf the observed Deployment.Spec does not match the desired spec\nDeployment was not found: create a new Deployment\nDeployment was found and changes are needed: update the Deployment\n\n\n\nvar _ reconcile.Reconciler = &ContainerSetController{}\n\nfunc (r *ContainerSetController) Reconcile(request reconcile.Request) (\n  reconcile.Result, error) {\n    // Read the ContainerSet\n  cs := &workloadv1beta1.ContainerSet{}\n  err := r.client.Get(context.TODO(), request.NamespacedName, cs)\n\n    // Handle deleted or error case\n  if err != nil {\n    if errors.IsNotFound(err) {\n      // Not found.

It's not necessary for day-to-day use of Kubebuilder, but can be useful\nif you want to understand how a particular version of Kubebuilder relates to\na particular version of Kubernetes.\n\nTL;DR\nAs of Kubebuilder 1.0.2:\n\nProjects generated with Kubebuilder list a semantic version of\ncontroller-runtime and controller-tools as their only direct\ndependencies. All other Kubernetes-related libraries are transative\ndependencies.\n\ncontroller-runtime and controller-tools each list a specific, identical\nset of dependencies on Kubernetes libraries and related libraries.\n\nOnce you've updated your dependencies with kubebuilder update vendor,\nyou'll be able to run dep ensure and dep ensure --update sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools to safely\nupdate all your dependencies in the future.\n\nYou can depend on controller-runtime to follow semantic versioning\nguarantees -- we won't break your code without\nintroducing a new major version, for both the interfaces in\ncontroller-runtime, and the bits of the kubernetes libraries that\ncontroller-runtime actually exposes.\n\n\nThe Problem with Kubernetes libraries\nThe kubernetes project exports a collection of libraries (which we'll call\nthe k8s-deps from now on) that expose common functionality used when\nbuilding applications that consume Kubernetes APIs (e.g. clients,\ninformers, etc).  Due to the way Kubrenetes is versioned\n(non-semantically), all of these dependencies must closely match --\ndiffering versions can cause strange compilation or runtime errors.\nBeyond this, these libraries have their own set of dependencies which are\nnot always the latest versions, or are occaisionally in-between versions.\nCollecting the correct set of dependencies for any given Kubernetes\nproject can thus be tricky.\nUsing Prebaked Manifests (Kubebuilder pre-1.0.2)\nBefore version 1.0.2, Kubebuilder shipped a pre-baked manifest of the\ncorrect dependencies.  When scaffolding out at new project using\nkubebuilder init (a kb-project), it would copy over a Gopkg.toml\nfile containing the exact dependency versions required for the project\n(which could then be used by dep dependency management tool to actually\nfetch the dependencies).\nIn addition to the Kubernetes dependencies required, this also specified\nthat all kb-projects use the master branch of the controller-runtime\nlibrary, which provides the abstractions that Kubebuilder is built upon.\nBecause controller-runtime wraps and consumes Kubernetes, it also needs\nspecific versions of the k8s-deps, and those version must match the ones\nlisted in the kb-project's Gopkg.toml, otherwise we'd have conflicting\ndependencies.\nThe Problem with Prebaked Manifests\nUsing the master branch as the target version of controller-runtime made\nit impossible to make breaking changes to controller-runtime.  However,\neven when using a specific version of controller-runtime, it's still\ndifficult to make changes.\nSince kb-projects must use an identical set of dependencies to\ncontroller-runtime, any update to the controller-runtime dependencies\n(say, to pull in a new feature) would have caused immediate dependency\nversion conflicts.  Effectively, any update to the dependencies had to be\ntreated as a major version revision, and there would have been no way to\ntell the difference between \"this release includes breaking API changes\"\nand \"this release simply switches to a newer version of the k8s-deps\".\nTransitive Dependencies (Kubebuilder 1.0.2+)\nAs noted above, any dependency version in kb-projects must match\ndependency versions listed in controller-runtime, exactly. Furthermore, it\nturns out, by design, the set of k8s-deps used in controller-runtime is\na superset of the set of dependencies actually imported by kb-projects.\nTherefore, in kb-projects generated with Kubebuilder 1.0.2+, no\ndependencies are listed besides controller-runtime (and controller-tools).\nAll of the k8s-deps become transitive dependencies, whose versions are\ndetermined when dep (the dependency management tool) looks at the\nversions required by controller-runtime.\ncontroller-runtime is semantically versioned, so any changes to either the\ninterfaces in controller-runtime, or the pieces of the k8s-deps that are\nexposed as part of those interfaces, means a new major version of\ncontroller-runtime will be released.  Any other changes (new features, bug\nfixes, updates to k8s-deps which don't break interfaces) yield minor or\npatch versions (as per semver), which can easily and\nsafely be updated to by kb-projects.\ncontroller-tools Dependencies\ncontroller-tools is the library used to generate CRD and RBAC manifests\nfor kb-projects.

You can find detailed steps\nhere.\nConfigure Admission Webhooks Dynamically\nAdmission webhooks can be configured dynamically via the admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 API.\nSo your cluster must be 1.9 or later and has enabled the API.\nYou can do CRUD operations on WebhookConfiguration objects as on other k8s objects.\napiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration\nmetadata:\n  name: \nwebhooks:\n- name: \n  rules:\n  - apiGroups:\n    - apps\n    apiVersions:\n    - v1\n    operations:\n    - CREATE\n    resources:\n    - deployments\n  clientConfig:\n    service:\n      namespace: \n      name: \n    caBundle: \n\n\n\n"},"beyond_basics/sample_webhook.html":{"url":"beyond_basics/sample_webhook.html","title":"Webhook Example","keywords":"","body":"Webhook Example\nThis chapter walks through a simple webhook implementation.\nIt uses the controller-runtime libraries to implement\na Webhook Server and Manager.\nSame as controllers, a Webhook Server is a\nRunable which needs to be registered to a manager.\nArbitrary number of Runables can be registered to a manager,\nso a webhook server can run with other controllers in the same manager.\nThey will share the same dependencies provided by the manager. For example, shared cache, client, scheme, etc.\nSetup\nWay to Deploy your Webhook Server\nThere are various ways to deploy the webhook server in terms of\n\nWhere the serving certificates live.\nIn what environment the webhook server runs, in a pod or directly on a VM, etc.\nIf in a pod, on what type of node, worker nodes or master node.\n\nThe recommended way to deploy the webhook server is\n\nRun the webhook server as a regular pod on worker nodes through a workload API, e.g. Deployment or StatefulSet.\nPut the certificate in a k8s secret in the same namespace as the webhook server\nMount the secret as a volume in the pod\nCreate a k8s service to front the webhook server.\n\nCreating a Handler\nThe business logic for a Webhook exists in a Handler.\nA Handler implements the admission.Handler interface, which contains a single Handle method.\nIf a Handler implements inject.Client and inject.Decoder interfaces,\nthe manager will automatically inject the client and the decoder into the Handler.\nNote: The client.Client provided by the manager reads from a cache which is lazily initialized.\nTo eagerly initialize the cache, perform a read operation with the client before starting the server.\npodAnnotator is a Handler, which implements the admission.Handler, inject.Client and inject.Decoder interfaces.\nDetails about how to implement an admission webhook podAnnotator is covered in a later section.\ntype podAnnotator struct {\n    client  client.Client\n    decoder types.Decoder\n}\n\n// podAnnotator implements admission.Handler.\nvar _ admission.Handler = &podAnnotator{}\n\nfunc (a *podAnnotator) Handle(ctx context.Context, req types.Request) types.Response {\n    ...\n}\n\n// podAnnotator implements inject.Client.\nvar _ inject.Client = &podAnnotator{}\n\n// InjectClient injects the client into the podAnnotator\nfunc (a *podAnnotator) InjectClient(c client.Client) error {\n    a.client = c\n    return nil\n}\n\n// podAnnotator implements inject.Decoder.\nvar _ inject.Decoder = &podAnnotator{}\n\n// InjectDecoder injects the decoder into the podAnnotator\nfunc (a *podAnnotator) InjectDecoder(d types.Decoder) error {\n    a.decoder = d\n    return nil\n}\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring a Webhook and Registering the Handler\nA Webhook configures what type of requests the Handler should accept from the apiserver.

Webhook Configurations with the apiserver to start accepting and\nrouting requests to the Handlers.\ncontroller-runtime provides a useful package for\nbuilding a webhook.\nYou can incrementally set
